# TODOs
# 1) Clean up and minior improvements
#    * Delete Project1.sln and add this filename to .gitignore
#    * Change the filename appveyor.yml to .appveyor.yml
#    * Let appveyor produce 64-bit builds
#    * Remove unnecessary code from appveyor.yml - which code is really needed and why is it really needed?
#    * Add an appveyor status badge (https://www.appveyor.com/docs/status-badges/), similar to the used travis status badge
# 2) Make Eigen work
#    * Change appveyor.yml so that the library Eigen can be used on appvoyer (probably, one has to make appveyor download Eigen from bitbuckets)
#    * Adapt the file cmake/FindEigen3.cmake so that the command "find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)" in the file CMakeLists.txt works on appveyor as well
#    * Uncomment the Eigen example in Source.cpp and let it run
# 3) Let appveyor publish the windows build to GitHub Releases (see https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/github/)
#    * Use similar settings as they are used in .travis.yml
